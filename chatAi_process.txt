Here i imported all the imported packets which are listed in the requirements.txt file.
Then created an interface of the streamlit for the frontend on the interface i am using the dynamically entring of the api_key from the user , when ever enters the api_key from the console.groq.com along with the pdf.
It will process the pdf and makings the chunckings of the pdf and the data stores on the faiss_index/index.faiss.
Then after submitting the user can prompt on the UI interface .
Based on the prompted it will gives the data which is more  accurate to the pdf file and along this it wil stores this answers in the index.faiss  for the purpose of the future to load it fast the data.
Here i listed the dataset.json by this dataset i given the pairs of question and answers these are generated by chatgpt by these i will test my RAG_AI how much accurate my Ai working.
Thank you.
